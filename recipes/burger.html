    <!-- The `<h1>Burger</h1>` is creating a heading level 1 element with the text "Burger". This is
    typically used to indicate the main heading or title of a webpage. -->
    <h1>Burger</h1>

    <!-- The `<img>` tag is used to display an image on a webpage. In this case, the `src` attribute
    specifies the URL of the image to be displayed. The `alt` attribute provides alternative text
    that is displayed if the image cannot be loaded. The `width` and `height` attributes specify the
    dimensions of the image in pixels. So, the code is displaying an image of a burger with a width
    of 400 pixels and a height of 400 pixels. -->

<!-- The `<p>` tag is used to create a paragraph element in HTML. In this case, the text inside the `<p>`
tags is a placeholder text commonly known as "Lorem Ipsum". It is often used as a filler text in web
design and typesetting to demonstrate the visual effects of different fonts, layouts, and designs.
The actual content of the paragraph can be replaced with relevant text for the webpage. -->
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Provident perspiciatis, amet placeat quos, delectus fuga, corrupti porro harum eum voluptates dolores quia ex dolor. Repellendus odio quasi pariatur neque dicta.</p>

<!-- The `<h3>Directions</h3>` is creating a heading level 3 element with the text "Directions". This is
typically used to indicate a subheading or a section title within a webpage. In this case, it is
used to introduce a list of directions or steps for a recipe or a set of instructions. -->
    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <!-- The `<ul>` tag is used to create an unordered list in HTML. The `<li>` tags within the `<ul>`
    tag are used to create individual list items. In this case, the code is creating a list of
    directions or steps for a recipe or a set of instructions. Each `<li>` tag represents a separate
    step in the process, such as preheating the grill, whisking together ingredients, adding ground
    beef, forming patties, placing patties on the grill, and serving the final dish. The unordered
    list format is used to present the steps in a bulleted format, without any specific order or
    hierarchy. -->
    <ul>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
        <li>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. ...
        </li>
        <li>Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands or a fork until well blended. ...
        </li>
        <li>Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties. ...
        </li>
        <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. ...
        </li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!
